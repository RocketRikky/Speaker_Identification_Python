# Speaker_Identification_Python

Extracted 20 MFCC features per .wav file and performed K-Means Clustering Algorithm to distinguish between the two speakers. 
The test file's features were then compared to the euclidean distance between the cluster centroids and the least distance was calculated
to identify the speaker.
